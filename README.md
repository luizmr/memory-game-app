## üíª About project

Game project made using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. It is a personal project about a memory game, which sets a sequence of random cubes, then you have to memorize it and click over the cubes in the same sequence it appeared. If you miss the sequence, it shows Game Over and a restart button, which reloads the application. Cool game to play and challenge your family during this quarantine.
